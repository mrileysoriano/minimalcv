## About me 

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the University of Miami pursuing my PhD in English. My research interests include: seriality studies, 19th century American periodicals and magazines, radical publishing, Caribbean Studies, and Lacanian psychoanalysis. 

My dissertation project--tentatively titled "'Broken Time': Serial Temporality in Nineteenth Century Radical Print"--examines the use of the serial media form by radical writers and thinkers in the labor, abolitionist, and feminist movements throughout the long nineteenth century. 

Dissertation Committee: John Funchion (Chair), Allison Schifani, and Tim Watson.
